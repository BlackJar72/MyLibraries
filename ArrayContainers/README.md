# Why This...?

Yes, I know, I should be using the standard libraries, but I don't like 
the STL containers (other than string), especially not vector.  Yeah, 
I'll get around to learning it, and perhaps why vector didn't do what 
I expected in string tokenizer (which led to my replacing it with my 
own dynamic array).  For now though, I think this would be better for 
my own personal use -- besides, it seems like an interesting learning 
project.  Maybe I'll even give them iterators eventually?
