# My Libraries

Just a place to keep my person static libraries.

These may or may not be complete, many are likely to be works in progress.

# No liability is accepted, period

No liability is accepted for anything related to these, not for any damages or any kind, nor for usefulness / fitness / marketability for any purpose whatsoever.  Actually, these are not being showed, not released.  When and if some of these 
become generally usable it will say so in that repository and I will decide at that time on a lisence.

Note that some of these are just well known public domain algorithms or mathematical opperations, so if you've seen something very 
similar elsewhere you basically already have rights to use those algorithms, but if you choose to use my implementation instead of 
your own (or someone else's) all liability is yours.  The point is that this is not being lisenced and I accept NO LIABILITY for 
any use or dirivative.
