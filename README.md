# My Libraries

Just a place to keep my person static libraries.

These may or may not be complete, many are likely to be works in progress.

These are not intended to replace STL classes, but mostly as a fun learning project.  Having said that, in
some cases they can be simpler to work with if less is needed and I suspect the registry class is something 
I can see using a lot for resource locators.  However, this is mostly a project I'm doing just because I can.

Also note, that these avoid directly using pointers except for the special case of their main data arrays. 
This is for flexibilty, as they can be made to hold pointers as the data types.

Like all these libraries, progress on this is likely to be slow simply because its not a priority and other 
things tend to take precedence over working on this.

Note that many of these may not have been properly tested, and as they are works in progress some may not
have been tested at all; its it not only possible but likely that many have serious bug

(I hate to have to explain this and sound like a [you-know-what], but you can't trust the internet so...)

# No liability is accepted, period

No liability is accepted for anything related to these, not for any damages or any kind, nor for usefulness / 
fitness / marketability for any purpose whatsoever.  Actually, these are only being shown, not released. 
When and if some of these become generally usable it will say so in that repository and I will decide at 
that time on a lisence, if any.

Note that some of these are just well known public domain algorithms or mathematical opperations, so if you've seen something very 
similar elsewhere you basically already have rights to use those algorithms, but if you choose to use my implementation instead of 
your own (or someone else's) all liability is yours.  The point is that this is not being lisenced and I accept NO LIABILITY for 
any use or dirivative.

Basically, if you use this code you are technically violating my implicit copyright and any problem resulting from 
such use is on you; you did not have permision to do so.
