These is a simple string tokenizing system I developed for reading config files 
in order improve on some short comings of Java's string tokenizer class (especially, 
its inability to account for quotations).  More to the point, it was part of 
Doomlike Dungeons, but I'm not porting it to C++, with some minor improvements, 
for more general use in other projects.
