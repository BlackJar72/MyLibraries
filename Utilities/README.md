# Utilities

These are very small programs, often in a single file, and generally commandline 
rather than gui based.  Not libraries, but not really worthy of a seperate repository. 
They are here because I've found them useful for some purpose (if not, they wouldn't 
have been written).

Some of these may also be quite old and here more as a matter of preservation than 
anything else.
